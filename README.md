# discord-webhooks
Simple wrapper for building and sending webhooks with Discord's webhook API

Allows for both simple small uses (single Webhook object to single Hook (url)) and mass dispatchers for multiple channels or with multiple Webhook object.

Built with simple end-user OOP approach in mind (method chaining for example).
